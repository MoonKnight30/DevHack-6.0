      "@BillAckman As a former Blackhawk pilot, it’s likely the crew experienced spatial disorientation. Flying at night in urban areas with NVGs can be challenging due to the brightness of the photons in the system. At 150 mph, moving lights can often appear static, and with only a 30-degree field https://t.co/5VSPDM7Rbd",

      "Hey, civilians, this is your scope of vision while wearing NVGs. Go ahead and put the picture right up to your nose if you want, and see how much of your field of vision is still not within that scope. \nSo, yes, it is completely possible the Blackhawk crew did not see the jet. https://t.co/zpMjCPIcz2",
      "There are so many ways an experienced pilot could have missed the jet.  I have over 800 hours flight time on night vision goggles (NVGs), and while I would certainly prefer to fly at night with NVGs they are not a panacea to see everything.  \n\nFirst of all, you only have about a 40 degree field of view (FOV), so you don't have enhanced visibility in your peripheral vision.  The brightness of the NVG image also tends to drown out normal lighting in your peripheral vision.  To counteract the limited FOV and maintain situational awareness of things all around your aircraft, you have to continuously be scanning and moving your head.  This limits the amount of time spent viewing and processing what is happening in each 40 degree cone you view.  It also means when focusing on a task or trying to keep something in view (like an aircraft you believe is the one you should be following), you tend to stop scanning.\n\nAlso notice how city lights at a distance start blooming out, creating little halos in the attached picture.  As you get closer and the intensity of lights increases, that blooming effect tends to expand.  Imagine being up close to the lights of Joint Base Anacostia/Bolling and trying to pick out a co-altitude aircraft out of the base lights and the National Harbor lights further down the river.  Additionally you run into an issue where the light intensification in the NVGs hits its maximum limit and the electronics will decrease the gain (or amplification) on the image to try to maintain some sort of useful image instead of whiting out completely.\n\nOn top of the difficulty in seeing aircraft on NVGs in a cluttered light environment, if the pilots truly believed the aircraft on 8 mile final to Rwy 01 was their ATC called traffic, then it's likely one pilot may have gone \"heads down\" to input a new frequency, to update their Flight Management System (FMS), or write down some notes related to the checkride.  The crew chief also could have either been on the right side of the helo or doing another task.  Totally normal sort of activities if there is not a perceived need to be focusing outside.  This would leave only one pilot looking outside with an increased risk in the few moments prior to the mid-air.",
